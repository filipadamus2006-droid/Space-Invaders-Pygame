Tested the drawplayer function I created. It worked fine and the player shows up on the screen in the right place.

Tested the movement, I realised the player can just go off the screen so i need to add some code that stops them from doing that.

When the game was played i realised the sprite i loaded had a black background that stood out against my games dark blue one so i just changed the background to black so you couldnt see it.
