Tested the drawplayer function I created. It worked fine and the player shows up on the screen in the right place.

Tested the movement, I realised the player can just go off the screen so i need to add some code that stops them from doing that.

When the game was played i realised the sprite i loaded had a black background that stood out against my games dark blue one so i just changed the background to black so you couldnt see it.

Fired bullets and checked movement - initially moved downwards, fixed by setting speed to -7. Bullets were slightly off-center - added +17 px to X..

Enemy displays correctly on screen. draw_enemy() works multiple times without error. Bullets still function normally with enemy on screen.
