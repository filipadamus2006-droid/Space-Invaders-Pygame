Started main loop today. First created a peice of code that tracks a variable called running which can be true or false. This is so the game can be quit out of later on

I also created a background using screen.fill and put my draw_player function (which i tested yesterday) into the main loop. I also set the clock to 60. Also added the flip() command which puts the buffered frame on the display.

Began creating player movement by checking the keyboard state and moving players X in the respective direction if it was pressed. 

Added code that keeps the player from leaving the screen.

Created a drawing function that draws the player at their current x and y co ordinates. Added this into the main loop
